  [17238]="Shall we begin, my friend?",
  [17240]="Hey, Cookie! What's for dinner tonight? And don't say chicken!",
  [17241]="Adamant, could you please take a look at this tablet and try to decipher the runes?",
  [17242]="Alright, let me take a look at that tablet.",
  [17243]="And now, I cut you!",
  [17246]="And fer dessert we be havin' cheesecake, flown in fresh from Stormwind on the wings o' angels...",
  [17312]="Father! Father! You're alive!",
  [17318]="Relax, Spark! I have it all under control. We'll strip mine the Exodar right out from under 'em - making both you and I very, very rich in the process.",
  [17359]="It is YOU who are wrong!  I will deal with you two after I have slain this meddlesome shaman!",
  [17375]="[Furbolg] Thank you, &lt;name&gt;!",
  [17391]="[Furbolg] Coo xip fly... Jump ilos river. Find Tikti.",
  [17392]="[Furbolg] Far you mixik tak come. Gaze upon the kitch'kal river. Follow. Ilog to Yor.",
  [17393]="[Furbolg] Come, &lt;name&gt;. Let us leave the water together, purified.",
  [17410]="[Furbolg] Bear witness to the savage acts of our adversaries, &lt;name&gt;. They steal our young... our weak... Imprisoned here, they are left to the devices of the Bristlelimb. Set them free, Promised One!",
  [17424]="But, no matter. Mister Clementine's... err, 'contribution' notwithstanding, this seems to be the journal of a man named Nolkai. The entries toward the end describe a brutal battle.",
  [17426]="Let her know... my last thought was of her...",
  [17433]="No, this can't be... It says this creature willingly became a servant of the Legion. He transforms into a satyr and receives the Legion's &quot;blessing.&quot;",
  [17443]="[Furbolg] Behold the prophecy!",
  [17445]="Stillpine raiders, the time to strike is at hand! Charge!",
  [17528]="Fools! Weaklings! Tzerak has no need of your assistance!",
  [17551]="Please tell Guvan that I'll be fine, thanks to you.",
  [17587]="Another victory for the draenei!",
  [17591]="For Silvermoon! For Sunstrider!",
  [17607]="Destroy the vermin!",
  [17613]="Blasted scrying crystal!  I'm not getting anything over here.",
  [17649]="You are going the wrong way, &lt;name&gt;. My elekk will not go into hostile territory.",
  [17658]="All hail &lt;name&gt;, savior of Azuremyst and Bloodmyst. Hero of the Hand of Argus, champion of the draenei people!",
  [17663]="If only I could get back to the mushroom thicket. I have not seen such a mature cluster in my lifetime!",
  [17664]="To the death!",
  [17678]="Petulant children, pray to your gods for you are about to meet them!",
  [17681]="By the forehead signet of Velen, I am saved!",
  [17682]="Thank you for saving me, &lt;name&gt;! My father will be delighted!",
  [17702]="Face the wrath of Bristlelimb!",
  [17703]="Don't you people ever check the mail?",
  [17715]="Who dares defile the statue of our beloved?",
  [17716]="Defend yourself, youngling! We'll see if there's a Blood Knight in you, yet.",
  [17768]="Don't get me wrong, &lt;name&gt;. I very much appreciate the resurrection, but I think this is the last time I'll perform this particular duty. Maybe a goblet or two of wine will help with this headache.",
  [17804]="The signal has been sent. He should be arriving shortly.",
  [17807]="Champion Lightrend, make me proud!",
  [17824]="Treacherous whelp! Sironas will destroy you and your people!",
  [17825]="Aren't you hungry? Thirsty? I can arrange for food and drink -- all you need to do is tell me what I want to know.",
  [17843]="Breathe your last breath, heathen.",
  [17853]="Return to Kuros. I will bring him to Blood Watch.",
  [17865]="Draenei dog! Did you know that the one you call Saruan wept like a babe as I beat him? A feeling of euphoria coursed through me, knowing that I had a member of high rank in my grasp. Were it not for Sironas' plans for him, I would have tortured him to death... As I do to all draenei that I capture. Alas, I am certain that you will see him again soon...",
  [17875]="Brothers and sisters, tonight we hunt! A blood elf known as Matis must be brought to justice! The first to find him gets one week's vacation aboard the Exodar!",
  [18175]="The rangers certainly have a high opinion of themselves.",
  [18253]="Do not be so harsh on the child, Alturus.  Remember that Cedric himself assigned him to you.",
  [18255]="S-sir... have you tried giving the crystal a good shake?  It's possible that the ley-lines are clouding up the reading.",
  [18338]="Azeroth has cowered too long under our shadow!  Now, feel the power of the Burning Crusade and despair!",
  [18810]="How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your fish?",
  [18927]="How could the elves betray us? We were never the greatest of friends, but joining the Horde?",
  [19148]="The Burning Legion has returned! What can we do to stop them?",
  [19175]="If the Dark Portal opens again, we could go home to Draenor.",
  [19178]="The Burning Legion has returned! What can we do to stop them?",
  [19456]="Haven't you done enough harm?  Must you also disturb my slumber?",
  [20102]="Elves or draenei, just means more money for our engineers.",
  [20227]="Looks like it's time to let you out of this cage.",
  [22062]="Excellent!  Fresh parts!",
  [23128]="Enhance and specialize your abilities with your talents!",
  [23566]="It would be a shame to let these leaflets go to waste, wouldn't it?",
  [23567]="Mysterious hoofprints, scorched shields, stray badges... how do we make sense of all this?",
  [23569]="Hey... what's this? A pair of manacles and not just any. These are enchanted. This cargo, it wasn't a thing... it was a person!",
  [23573]="I don't think Drazzit's going to have any luck finding anyone to kill this raptor. I mean, he's already raised the reward twice...",
  [23579]="But this the only building that fit Brogg! Goblins make buildings too small!",
  [23600]="Hmm... I wonder...",
  [23602]="If you think you can stop us, you're mistaken, 'friend.'",
  [23618]="I miss my dog so much!",
  [23720]="Thank you! There's no telling what those brutes would've done to me.",
  [23786]="I'll crush you!",
  [23789]="Pitiful mortal, Onyxia answers to no one!",
  [23843]="Go on, open it. I think you'll like it.",
  [23861]="Go away, whoever you are! Witch Hill is mine... mine!",
  [23864]="All who venture here belong to me, including you!",
  [23896]="You might wanna stand back. Fish guttin' is a dirty job.",
  [23900]="We defeated the sea monster!",
  [23905]="FIRE AT WILL!",
  [23941]="I surrender! Stay your blade!",
  [23995]="I thought we talked about this, Brogg. You can't stay in this building. Sure, it can house you, but there's no room for anyone else!",
  [185403]="The cart! How did this happen? Relathor, come quickly, there's a fire!",
  [185404]="I'm coming Cyriden!",
